# COSC 304 - Introduction to Database Systems<br>Lab 10: Project Completion

## Unit 15: Creating and Using Dynamic Actions and Plug-ins

This exercise includes nine hands-on-labs. HOL 15-1 through 15-8 use the Demo Projects   application.

### HOL 15-1 Creating and Using a Dynamic Action on the Maintain Project Page: 
In this lab, you add a dynamic action on the Maintain Project page to show or hide the Completed Date based on the value of Status.

### HOL 15-2 Creating and Using a Dynamic Action on the Maintain Task Page: 
In this lab, you add a dynamic action on the Maintain Task page to populate the Due Date whenever the Milestone is changed.

### HOL 15-3 Creating and Using Dynamic Actions on the Project Tree Page: 
This lab covers creating two buttons that you use to expand and contract the project tree nodes. You create a dynamic action on each of these buttons. Then, for each of the button, you set the action as defined by the dynamic action.

### HOL 15-4 Creating and Using a Plug-in: 
In this hands-on lab, you create a copy of the Badge List Plug-in from the Sample Charts packaged app. Then, on the Reports page, you create a badge list region. On this region, you display three different badges: Open Projects, Upcoming Milestones, and Open Tasks.

### HOL 15-5 Adding Additional Reports: 
In this lab, you clean up the Dashboard page by moving two regions as separate pages. Later, you add in new regions to the Dashboard page.

### HOL 15-6 Updating the Reports Page: 
In this lab, you add new components to the Reports page of the Demo Projects application.

### HOL 15-7 Updating the Dashboard Page: 
In this lab, you update the Dashboard page of the Demo Projects application. The Dashboard should display the Project Status chart, Upcoming Milestones report and Incomplete Tasks.

### HOL 15-8 Updating the Home Page: 
In this lab, you update the navigation menu of the Demo Projects application and also update the List region on the Home page.

### HOL 15-9 Making the Music Video Report Searchable: 
In this lab, you use the APEX and REST application that you created in HOL 11-2. You expand the music video report and make it dynamically searchable.

### HOL 15-1: Creating and Using a Dynamic Action on the Maintain Project Page

On the Maintain Project page, the Completed Date field is displayed irrespective of the value of
Status. In this lab, you add a dynamic action on the page to show or hide the Completed Date based on the value of Status.

1.	Navigate to App Builder and click the `Demo Projects` application.

2.	In the Demo Projects application home page, click `Shared Components`.


3.	You want to create a dynamic LOV for Status. Under Other Components, click `List of Values`.

4.	Click `Create`.

5.	Accept the default for Source and click Next.

6.	For Name, enter `Status`, and click `Next`.

7.	In List of Values Source, for Source Type select SQL Query, and for Query, copy and paste the following SQL:

	```
select description d, cd r
from demo_proj_status
order by display_order
   ```   

	Click `Next`.

8.	In Column Mappings, Select R for Return Column and click Create.

	In the Application Express toolbar, click `Run Page <n>`.

9.	In the Demo Projects application runtime environment, click Projects in the navigation menu.

      Then, in the interactive report, select a project name with status as IN-PROGRESS or 
      ASSIGNED.

      In the dialog page, for Status, select each of the values Assigned, Completed, and In-Progress. 

      Notice that the Completed Date field is displayed irrespective of the status.

      You want to create a dynamic action that will allow the display of the Completed Date field only if the status is *Completed*.

  In the Developer toolbar, click `Edit Page 5`.

10.	In the page designer, expand `Regions > Project > Items`.

	Right-click the `P5_STATUS_CD` item and select `Create Dynamic Action`.

11.	In the property editor:

	- Identification > Name: Enter `Show Completed Date`
	- Client-side Condition > Type: Select `Item = Value`
	- Client-side Condition > Value: Enter `COMPLETED`

	**Note:** The capitalization and spelling of the value must match the data entry value exactly in order for the dynamic action to fire.

12.	In the Rendering tree, under the Show Completed Date dynamic action, expand the `True` node and select `Show`.

In the Property Editor, for Item(s) select `P5_COMPLETED_DATE`.

13.	Right-click `Show` and select `Create Opposite Action`.

14.	Notice that the opposite action is created now. The Completed Date field will be hidden if the Status includes a value other than COMPLETED.

	Click `Save`.

15.	Now, you can verify to see if the dynamic action works as expected.

	Navigate to the Demo Projects application runtime environment. If the Maintain Project dialogue is open, click `Cancel`.

	In the navigation menu, click `Projects` and then in the report, click any project name with the Status COMPLETED.

	Notice that the Completed Date field is displayed.

16.	In the Maintain Project dialogue, for Status, select either Assigned or In-Progress.

	Notice that this time, the Completed Date field is hidden.

	Click the `Cancel` button.

### HOL 15-2: Creating and Using a Dynamic Action on the Maintain Task Page

In this hands-on lab, you add a dynamic action on the Maintain Task page to populate the Due Date whenever the Milestone is changed.

1.	In the Demo Projects application runtime environment, click `Tasks` in the navigation menu.

2.	In the interactive report, click the Edit icon for a task name.

3.	In the Developer Toolbar, click `Edit Page 9`.

	On this page, you want to populate the Due Date whenever the Milestone is changed. In order to achieve this, you will use a Dynamic Action with an action of Set Value, which can execute an AJAX call to retrieve data from the database.

4.	Under Rendering > Regions > Maintain Task, expand items.

	Right-click `P9_MILESTONE_ID` and select `Create Dynamic Action`.

5.	For the new Dynamic Action, in the Property Editor, for Name enter Get Due Date.

6.	In the Rendering tree, under the P9_MILESTONE_ID item, select the Action under the True node (currently labeled X Show).

	In the Property Editor:
	- Identification: Action - select Set Value
	- Settings: Set Type - select SQL Statement
	- Settings: SQL Statement - copy and paste the following code:

	```
select due_date
from demo_proj_milestones
where id = :P9_MILESTONE_ID
	```

	- Settings: Items to Submit - select `P9_MILESTONE_ID`

	Click `Save`.

7.	Navigate to Demo Projects application runtime environment.

	In the navigation menu, click `Tasks`.

	In the interactive report, click the Edit icon for a task with milestones.


8.	Try selecting different values for Milestone to see how the Due Date is updated based on the selection.

### HOL 15-3: Creating and Using Dynamic Actions on the Project Tree Page

In this lab, you update the Project Tree page that you created in HOL 14-6. You add two buttons: Collapse All and Expand All. You use them to expand and contract the project tree nodes. You also create a dynamic action on each of these buttons. Then, for each of the buttons, you set the action as defined by the dynamic action.

1.	Navigate to Demo Projects application runtime environment. In the navigation menu, under Reports, click `Project Tree`.

	In the Developer Toolbar, click `Edit Page <n>`.

2.	Now, to expand and collapse the project tree nodes, you want to create Expand All and Collapse All buttons on the Project Tree button. These buttonsâ€™ actions are defined by dynamic actions.

	Under Rendering, expand `Regions > Breadcrumb`.

	Right-click `Breadcrumb` and select `Create Button`.

3.	In the Property Editor:

	- Identification > Button Name: Enter `CONTRACT_ALL`
	- Identification > Label: Enter `Collapse All`
	- Layout > Button Position: `Select Edit`

4.	In the Property Editor, for Behavior > Action: Select `Defined by Dynamic Action`.
Under Appearance, click `Template Options` button.

5.	Deselect the `Use Template Defaults` check box and click `OK`.

6.	Now, right-click the `CONTRACT_ALL` button and select `Duplicate`.

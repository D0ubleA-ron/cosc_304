# COSC 304 - Introduction to Database Systems<br>Lab 10: Project Completion

## Unit 15: Creating and Using Dynamic Actions and Plug-ins

This exercise includes nine hands-on-labs. HOL 15-1 through 15-8 use the Demo Projects   application.

### HOL 15-1 Creating and Using a Dynamic Action on the Maintain Project Page: 
In this lab, you add a dynamic action on the Maintain Project page to show or hide the Completed Date based on the value of Status.

### HOL 15-2 Creating and Using a Dynamic Action on the Maintain Task Page: 
In this lab, you add a dynamic action on the Maintain Task page to populate the Due Date whenever the Milestone is changed.

### HOL 15-3 Creating and Using Dynamic Actions on the Project Tree Page: 
This lab covers creating two buttons that you use to expand and contract the project tree nodes. You create a dynamic action on each of these buttons. Then, for each of the button, you set the action as defined by the dynamic action.

### HOL 15-4 Creating and Using a Plug-in: 
In this hands-on lab, you create a copy of the Badge List Plug-in from the Sample Charts packaged app. Then, on the Reports page, you create a badge list region. On this region, you display three different badges: Open Projects, Upcoming Milestones, and Open Tasks.

### HOL 15-5 Adding Additional Reports: 
In this lab, you clean up the Dashboard page by moving two regions as separate pages. Later, you add in new regions to the Dashboard page.

### HOL 15-6 Updating the Reports Page: 
In this lab, you add new components to the Reports page of the Demo Projects application.

### HOL 15-7 Updating the Dashboard Page: 
In this lab, you update the Dashboard page of the Demo Projects application. The Dashboard should display the Project Status chart, Upcoming Milestones report and Incomplete Tasks.

### HOL 15-8 Updating the Home Page: 
In this lab, you update the navigation menu of the Demo Projects application and also update the List region on the Home page.

### HOL 15-9 Making the Music Video Report Searchable: 
In this lab, you use the APEX and REST application that you created in HOL 11-2. You expand the music video report and make it dynamically searchable.

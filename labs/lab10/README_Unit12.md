# COSC 304 - Introduction to Database Systems<br>Lab 10: Project Completion

### Unit 12: Using Themes and Theme Styles

This exercise includes two hands-on labs.

- HOL 12-1 Updating the Team Members Pages: In this hands-on lab, you create a Classic Report region and update the report template to use Cards. You also specify template options.

- HOL 12-2 Creating and Using Theme Styles: In this hands-on lab, you use the Budget App application. You use the Theme Roller to save the changes made to the Theme Style and then enable users to apply this Theme Style in the running application.

#### HOL 12-1: Updating the Team Member Pages

In this lab, you update the Team Member pages by replacing the interactive report with a card region. This provides a directory of your team members' contact information and roles as though you had a stack of their business cards at hand.

1.	In the Demo Projects application runtime environment, click Team Members in the navigation menu.
In the Developer Toolbar, click Edit Page 2.

2.	Update the interactive report region title from Proj Team Members to Team Members.

3.	This page is an interactive report. You want to convert the report type to a Classic Report type so that you can utilize one of the built-in templates. Update the interactive report to a Classic Report, and apply the Cards template to display the team members in a more visually pleasing manner.
Click the Team Members region and input the following:

	- Identification: Type - select Classic Report
	- Source: Type â€“ select SQL Query

4.	In the SQL Query attribute, click the Code Editor button.

5.	In the Code Editor window, delete the existing SQL Query and copy and paste the following code:

	```
     select id
, full_name card_title
, profile card_text
, nvl(email,' ') card_subtext
, dbms_lob.getlength('PHOTO_BLOB') card_initials
, apex_util.prepare_url('f?p='||:APP_ID||':3:'||:APP_SESSION||'::::P3_ID:'||id) card_link
, photo_filename
, photo_mimetype
, photo_charset
, photo_last_updated
from demo_proj_team_members
order by created
	```
	
	Then, click OK.

     Note: This SQL query uses specific column names, such as card_title, which correspond to the 
     columns required for the Card template.

6.	The report region has the required Type and SQL Source, now the report needs to be enhanced to display an image and utilize the correct report template.
The DEMO_PROJ_TEAM_MEMBERS table includes columns which store an image and the image's associated properties. You can use this information to show the team Member's stored image, instead of the member's initials in the cards report.

	Under the Rendering > Regions, locate Team Members, and expand the Columns node.

	Select the CARD\_INITIALS column, and input the following:
	- Identification: Type - select Display Image
	- BLOB Attributes: Table Name - select DEMO\_PROJ\_TEAM\_MEMBERS
	- BLOB Attributes: BLOB Column - select PHOTO_BLOB
	- BLOB Attributes: Primary Key Column 1 - select ID
	- BLOB Attributes: Mime Type Column - select PHOTO_MIMETYPE
	- BLOB Attributes: Filename Column - select PHOTO_FILENAME
	- BLOB Attributes: Last Updated Column - select PHOTO\_LAST\_UPDATED
	
7.	Under Rendering, expand the Team Members region. Select Attributes.
In the property editor, locate Appearance. For Template, select Cards.
Click Template Options.

8.	In the Template Options dialog:

	- Icons - select Display Initials
	- Layout - select 4 Columns
	- Body Text - select 3 Lines

	Click OK.

9.	Click Save and Run Page to see the new cards.


#### HOL 12-2: Using Themes and Theme Styles

In this hands-on lab, you use the Theme Roller to save a Theme Style. Then, you enable end-users to apply this style while running the application.

1.	Navigate to App Builder and then run the Budget App application.
	
	In the Developer Toolbar, click Theme Roller.

2.	The current Theme Style is Vita.
Under Global Colors, click the colour swatch to select new colours.

	To edit a specific component, expand a group and select new colours or styling of the component you wish to edit.

	Modify the look by specifying colours of your choice and previewing the changes. Once you are done, click Save As.

3.	In the Save As dialogue, enter Vita (Copy) for Style Name and click Save.

4.	Click OK.

5.	Click Application < n > in the Developer Toolbar.

	In the application home page, click Shared Components.

	Under User Interface, click User Interface Attributes.

6.	Under User Interfaces, click the Edit icon for Desktop.

7.	Under Attributes, click Enable End Users to Choose Theme Style. Make sure this attribute is set to On.

	Notice that the new Theme Style you saved is displayed under the Theme Style list.

	Click Apply Changes.

8.	Now, run the application. At the bottom of the page, click the Customize link.

# COSC 304 - Introduction to Database Systems<br>Lab 6: Using Java/Python with MySQL and Microsoft SQL Server

This lab shows how Java and Python programs can connect to MySQL and Microsoft SQL Server.

## Part #1: MySQL

Download [the sample Java program](code/TestJDBCMySQL.java) or [sample Python program](code/PythonQueryExample.py) that connects to a WorksOn database hosted by MySQL. If running Java, setup your Eclipse project. For Python, setup your Python environment using Jupyter Notebook or an editor like Spyder (install with [Anaconda Python 3.8 distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)).

Your MySQL user id is the first letter in your first name followed by up to 7 letters of your last name and your initial password is your student id.  For more information on how to login and use MySQL, see <a href="http://people.ok.ubc.ca/rlawrenc/teaching/304/Notes/mysql.html">Using MySQL</a>.

To make the Java program work:

```
Change Line 5 to:	String url = "jdbc:mysql://cosc304.ok.ubc.ca/workson";
Change Line 6 to:	String uid = "put your user id here";
Change Line 7 to:	String pw = "put your password here";
```

To make the Python program work:

```
Change Line 3 to:	cnx = mysql.connector.connect(user='put your user id here', password='put your password here', host='cosc304.ok.ubc.ca', database='workson')
```

The result of the program is this:

```
Employee Name,Salary
M. Smith,50000.0
A. Lee,40000.0
J. Miller,20000.0
B. Casey,50000.0
L. Chu,30000.0
R. Davis,40000.0
J. Jones,50000.0
```

## Question #1

Create a new program called `MyJDBC.java` or `MySQLQuestion.py`.

Note: With Python to have multiple cursors on a connection, set the cursor to buffering like this: `cursor = cnx.cursor(buffered=True)`.

Your program should be able to do this:

- List each employee that is a supervisor.
- Sort the list of supervisors by name.
- Under each supervisor, list the employees that he/she <b>directly</b> supervises sorted by decreasing salary.

The result of your program should look like this:

```
Supervisor: B. Casey
   M. Smith, 50000.00

Supervisor: J. Jones
   B. Casey, 50000.00
   R. Davis, 40000.00

Supervisor: L. Chu
   J. Miller, 20000.00

Supervisor: M. Smith
   J. Doe, 30000.00
   
Supervisor: R. Davis
   A. Lee, 40000.00
   L. Chu, 30000.00
```

## Part #2: Microsoft SQL Server

### Java Setup

1. [Download the Microsoft SQL Server driver](code/sqljdbc4.jar) and put it in your classpath or in the `lib\ext` folder of your JRE.

2. Open Eclipse.  Select `File`, `New`, `Java project`. ([screenshot](img/EclipseJavaProject.png))

3. [Download the sample file](code/TestJdbcSqlServer.java).  Save this file in your Eclipse workspace under the project folder that you just created. 

4. These are the modifications you must make to get the program working:

```
Change Line 5 to:	String url = "jdbc:sqlserver://sql04.ok.ubc.ca;DatabaseName=WorksOn;";
Change Line 6 to:	String uid = "put your user id here";
Change Line 7 to:	String pw = "put your password here";
```

### Python Setup

1. Install SQL Server pyodbc connector by following [these directions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/python/python-driver-for-sql-server).

2. [Download the sample Python file](code/PythonSQLServer.py) and setup in your Python environment.

3. These are the modifications you must make to get the program working:

```
Change Line 3 and 4 to:	cnx = pyodbc.connect("""DRIVER={ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server};SERVER=sql04.ok.ubc.ca;
							DATABASE=workson;UID=yourUserId;PWD=yourPassword""")
```

### Expected Output

```
Employee Name,Salary
M. Smith,50000.0
A. Lee,40000.0
J. Miller,20000.0
B. Casey,50000.0
L. Chu,30000.0
R. Davis,40000.0
J. Jones,50000.0
```

## Question #2

Modify either the Java or Python sample program to create a program that lists the top project for each department based on the total hours worked by employees on projects.

### Expected Output

```
Id: D1     Name: Management
Proj#	Name	Total Hours
P1   	Instruments	36

Id: D2     Name: Consulting
Proj#	Name	Total Hours
P4   	Maintenance	96

Id: D3     Name: Accounting
Proj#	Name	Total Hours
P3   	Budget	46
```

 Labs

All labs are done online with assistance from teaching assistants and instructor during session hours. The best part of the course is developing with databases in the labs. Please follow the submission guidelines.

**All labs must be done in groups. Labs 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 9 are done in pairs. Project labs 5, 7, 8, and 10 are done in groups of four.** No collaboration outside a group is allowed. The group must be setup on Canvas (contact TA/instructor) and only one submission per group is accepted.

## Submission Guidelines for Assignments

### Assignment Submission Rules
All assignments will be collected and marked using Canvas unless otherwise noted.
Although you are able to develop your code on any environment, for marking purposes your final result must compile and run on the course server.

### How to Electronically Submit Your Assignments
When electronically submitting multiple code files (> 5 files), please zip the directory before submitting.
Note that you can resubmit an assignment, and the new submission overwrites the old submission and receives a new timestamp.

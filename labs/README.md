# Lab Assignments

All lab assignments are done online with assistance from teaching assistants and the instructor during session hours. The best part of the course is developing with databases in the assignments. Please follow the submission guidelines.

**All assignments must be done in groups. Labs 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 9 are done in pairs. Project labs 5, 7, 8, and 10 are done in groups of four.** No collaboration outside a group is allowed. The group must be setup on Canvas (contact TA/instructor) and only one submission per group is accepted.

**Many assignments use Docker to run databases on your computer. Follow the [setup instructions](setup) to get started.**
